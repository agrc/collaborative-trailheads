# collaborative-trailheads

Processes and tools used to compare SGID trailheads with OSM trailheads to create a map roulette challenge to update OSM with government data. The ultimate goal is having OSM data becoming a data source for SGID data.

As of 2022-08-30, OSM has 119 trailheads while the SGID trailheads contains 568. We plan to intersect our data with OSM and create a map roulette challenge to incorporate the SGID data into OSM. 

After this challenge is completed, we will have opportunities to use OSM and it's communtity as a data steward for updates and changes to trailhead locations and attributes.
